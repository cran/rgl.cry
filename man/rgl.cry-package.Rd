\title{rgl.cry: 'cry' and 'rgl' — Applications in Crystallography}
\description{
Visualizing crystal structures and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. It provides functions cry_demo() and dp_demo() to load a file in 'CIF' (Crystallographic Information Framework) formats and display crystal structures and electron diffraction patterns. The function dp_demo() also performs simple simulation of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns, and the results can be saved to a file in the working directory. The package has been tested on several platforms, including Linux on 'Crostini' with a Core™ m3-8100Y Chromebook, I found that even on this low-powered platform, the performance was acceptable. T.
